<h1>Inheritance</h1>

<hr width="200" align="left"/>	

<p>InheritanceÂ is the mechanism through which certain properties are passed on from a parent element down to its child elements.</p>

<p>Inheritance is the process by which properties are passed from parent to child elements even though those properties have not been explicitly defined by other means. Certain properties are inherited automatically, and as the name implies, a child element will take on the characteristics of its parent with regards to these properties.</p>
