<h1>What is HTML?</h1>

<strong>HTML is a language for describing web pages.</strong>
<ul>
<li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
<li>HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language</li>
<li>A markup language is a set of markup tags</li>
<li>HTML uses markup tags to describe web pages</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of a web browser <strong>(like Internet Explorer or Firefox)</strong> is to read HTML documents and display them as web pages. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses the tags to interpret the content of the page:</p>

<h1>HTML Tags<br>

<h1>What You Need</h1>

Y;ou don't need any tools to learn HTML at W3Schools.

You don't need an HTML editor
You don't need a web server
You don't need a web site

<h1>Editing HTML</h1>

HTML can be written and edited using many different editors like Dreamweaver and Visual Studio.

However, in this tutorial we use a plain text editor (like Notepad) to edit HTML. We believe using a plain text editor is the best way to learn HTML.

<h1>Create Your Own Test Web</h1>

If you just want to learn HTML, skip the rest of this chapter.

If you want to create a test page on your own computer, just copy the 3 files below to your desktop.

(Right click on each link, and select "save target as" or "save link as")

mainpage.htm

page1.htm

page2.htm

After you have copied the files, you can double-click on the file called "mainpage.htm" and see your first web site in action.

<h1>Use Your Test Web For Learning</h1>

We suggest you experiment with everything you learn at W3Schools by editing your web files with a text editor (like Notepad).

Note: If your test web contains HTML markup tags you have not learned, don't panic. You will learn all about it in the next chapters.

<h1>HTM or .HTML File Extension?</h1>

When you save an HTML file, you can use either the .htm or the .html file extension. There is no difference, it is entirely up to you.
