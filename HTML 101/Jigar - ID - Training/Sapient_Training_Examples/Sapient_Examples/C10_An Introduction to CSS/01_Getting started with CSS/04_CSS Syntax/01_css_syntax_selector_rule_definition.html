<p>css syntax / selector / rule / definition is nothing but the way to write/declare css properties for an element. </p>

<p>
A CSS rule has two main parts: a selector, and one or more declarations:

<strong><br/><br/>
h1<br/>
{<br/>
	color:red;<br/>
	/* insert comments in any */<br/>
}<br/>
</strong>

</p>

<ul>
    <li>The selector is normally the HTML element you want to style.</li>
    
    <li>Each declaration consists of a property and a value.</li>
    
    <li>The property is the style attribute you want to change. Each property has a value. </li>
    
    <li>A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration groups are surrounded by curly brackets:</li>
</ul>
