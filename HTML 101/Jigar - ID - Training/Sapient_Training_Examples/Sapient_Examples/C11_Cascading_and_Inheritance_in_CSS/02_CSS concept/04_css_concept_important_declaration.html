<p>!important is basically a keyword you can add to the end of a CSS property/value pair to give more weight to that CSS value.</p> 


<p>The reason it is used is due to the nature of CSS, which assigns weight to values according to where they appear in the “cascade”. </p>


<p>An !important declaration provides a way for a stylesheet author to give a CSS value more weight than it naturally has. It should be noted here that the phrase “!important declaration” is a reference to an entire CSS declaration, including property and value, with !important added (thanks to Brad Czerniak for pointing out this discrepancy).</p>


<p id="mainPara" style="color:blue">Here is a simple code example that clearly illustrates how !important affects the natural way that styles are applied:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tag</li>
	<li>Class</li>
	<li>Id</li>
	<li>Compound</li>

</ul>
